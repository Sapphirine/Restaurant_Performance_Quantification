# Restaurant_Performance_Quantification
Restaurant Performance Quantification relies on the topic modeling processes using Latent Dirichlet Allocation that allows to learn the latent subtopics in review text. We mainly focused on the reviews consisting of Cafes and Bars. We tried to understand the sentiments people express related to these words and so used Word2Vec to find the other word correlated with these. For these related words we performed sentiment analysis to generate a score. Hence, business can understand where they are doing well and where they need to improve.
Keywords - Topic Modeling;  Latent Dirichlet Allocation; Sentiment Analysis;  Word2Vec
Used Pyspark library Mllib, NTLK for the analysis
